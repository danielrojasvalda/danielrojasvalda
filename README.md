- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielrojasvalda,
  I am a software engineer with years of experience in Bolivia. Over the years, my career has been dedicated to specialized software development, driven by a deep passion for crafting innovative solutions.

  During the transitional period of country relocation, when the technology industry experienced a slowdown due to the impact of COVID-19, I embraced the opportunity to explore new branches within technology. Despite this, my focus remained resolute on continuing my journey as a software developer in the new landscape.

  Currently enrolled in a comprehensive Software Developer Bootcamp, further enriching my skill set and knowledge in the field. My commitment to software development and continuous learning remains unwavering. As a software developer, I have a proven track record of delivering quality results to clients. I excel in full-stack development, leveraging my skills in JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and various programming languages to create dynamic and engaging web applications. Additionally, I have experience troubleshooting front-end issues and driving innovation.

- 💞️ Eager to apply my proficiency in Python, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more to make a valuable impact on a tech company's success.
