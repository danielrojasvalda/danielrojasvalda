- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielrojasvalda, 
With skills such as presenting HTML, JavaScript, and CSS layouts and mockups to clients, and troubleshooting front-end related bugs on clients’ websites. I like understanding the client's idea and putting it on the screen.
My career path: I started as a full-stack developer when PHP was the fastest-growing language, developing complete e-learning platforms. I worked twice on government technology projects in my country, Bolivia. Starting as a member of the Bureau of Economy development team, and then as the Head of Technology Department in a laptop and cell phone assembly company.
My passion for web development encouraged me to open my own development company, supporting companies to learn about the advantages of electronic commerce.
During my career, I’ve been able to learn and make an impact with quite a few tools and methodologies, among which I highlight:
Scrum/Agile development methodologies 
Version control system GIT, SVN
UI/UX technologies
Linux, Windows
HTML, HTML5
CSS, CSS3
Bootstrap
JavaScript
Angular
JQuery
Java
PHP 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Front End projects.
